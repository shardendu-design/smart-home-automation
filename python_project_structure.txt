This should prevent the screen from blanking due to inactivity on your Raspberry Pi. 
If there are any other power management settings you need to adjust, let me know, 
and I can provide guidance on how to do so.


sudo nano /etc/default/console-setup

Find the line that starts with BLANK_TIME and POWERDOWN_TIME, and set both values to 0. 
If these lines don't exist, you can add them at the end of the file:

BLANK_TIME=0
POWERDOWN_TIME=0

After making these changes, reboot your Raspberry Pi for the settings to take effect:

sudo reboot

**********************
If adjusting the console-setup configuration didn't prevent the screen from sleeping on your Raspberry Pi, 
there may be other settings or configurations affecting the display power management. Here are some 
additional steps you can try:

Disable Screen Blanking via Terminal: In addition to adjusting the console-setup configuration file, 
you can try disabling screen blanking directly via terminal commands. Run the following commands 
in the terminal:

sudo sh -c 'TERM=linux setterm -blank 0 >/dev/tty0'
sudo sh -c 'TERM=linux setterm -powerdown 0 >/dev/tty0'

it won't persist across reboots unless you configure them to do so

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

sh -c 'TERM=linux setterm -blank 0 >/dev/tty0'
sh -c 'TERM=linux setterm -powerdown 0 >/dev/tty0'

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Make the script executable:

sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
